### Notes
The main challenge I had in this part was debugging my code and interpreting the warning statements, which eventually led to resolving my bugs. Although the AlamofireImage framework was highlighted as red, it still worked when I ran the app. At first, I thought it would be a futile effort to run the program when there is an error, but apparently running it actually fixed the problem. This is an important lesson that can be applied to future debugging sessions.
